# Project Description
Edify is an online tutoring platform designed to connect prospective tutors to willing tutees in the university. Edify allows for tutors and tutees to create an account and sign up, search for tutors, manage their schedules, and book sessions. Furthermore, the Edify platform allows for full CRUD functionality via the included administrator panel. <br><br>

It was developed as a project in a Web Engineering course in March, 2020. <br><br>

We also developed a hi-fi prototype for a mobile version of this application using Protopie.
